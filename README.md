I started to use BEM, so jsut close #20.

#### Close - #21

> Practice close issuses

- **close #21 #22**
  Only #21 closed

- **close #22**
  #22 closed

  But, I can't sure that this way close only one issue.
  The issue #22 don't show a commit 'close #22', though it closed.

#### Close - #22

> Fix nested CSS error when React rendered

1. **Move postcss-nesting to devDependencies**
   Error

2. **Uninstall postcss-nesting**
   Error

3. **Remove 'tailwind.config.js'**
   No error

This error must occur when 'tailwind.config.js' exist in project directory.
